# XADMaster - Modified Library for iComics

This is the copy of the XADMaster framework that was implemented
into iComics v1.1 onwards.

It has been stripped down to the bare elements required to function,
and certain methods have been modified to align with the iComics codebase 
properly.

Per the LGPL agreement, it is publically available here, for free.

XADMaster was originally created by [Dag Ã…gren](http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html), with the original codebase featured in [The Unarchiver](https://code.google.com/p/theunarchiver/).
